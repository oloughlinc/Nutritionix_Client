# Nutritionix_Client

I started this to learn about making API calls over HTTP. This project uses a sensible language: Java, since it has many built in tools available for making calls and parsing responses. Maven is used to handle dependancies of which there is only one, the JSON parser, which is built in to enterprise Java.

This is a simple POST example searching the nutritionix database.
